### Summary of Key Differences

- **Kernel Type**:
  - **Regular**: Basic convolutional layers (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet).
  - **Depthwise**: Reduces computation by separating spatial and channel-wise convolutions (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet).
  - **Atrous**: Dilated convolutions capture larger context without downsampling (e.g., DeepLab).
  - **Deformable**: Allows flexible receptive fields to adjust for object shape and scale (e.g., Deformable ConvNets).
  
- **Kernel Size**:
  - **VGG** and **ResNet** primarily use \(3 x 3\) kernels for deeper architectures, while **AlexNet** and **Inception** use a variety of kernel sizes for multi-scale feature capture.

- **Connections**:
  - **Skip Connections** in **ResNet** and **Dense Connections** in **DenseNet** mitigate gradient vanishing and allow deep layers.
  - **Inception Modules** in **GoogLeNet** allow multi-scale processing within a single layer.

- **Parameters**:
  - **EfficientNet** uses compound scaling for efficient resource use across different model sizes, while **MobileNet** optimizes for mobile use.
  - **YOLO** maintains a moderate parameter count, focusing on speed for object detection.

This table captures the design principles of each model, which enable them to excel in different computer vision tasks.
